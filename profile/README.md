# Project Netherworld is a Conversational Agent Application Designed to be Robust yet Simple. 

## Features
- Variety of robust Discord slash commands to assist with various topics from conversation to writing.
- Several experimental warpers and processors such as [top_a](https://github.com/BlinkDL/RWKV-LM/tree/4cb363e5aa31978d801a47bc89d28e927ab6912e#the-top-a-sampling-method), [Tail Free Sampling]((https://www.trentonbricken.com/Tail-Free-Sampling/)), and 
[logit_bias](https://help.openai.com/en/articles/5247780-using-logit-bias-to-alter-token-probability-with-the-openai-api) to help customize conversations and text generation. 
- Many settings for customizability, all of which can be set through a [Settings Builder Web UI](https://project-netherworld.github.io/IdolaDeus/).
- A Front End and Back End, allowing for either running both locally or between two different computers.
